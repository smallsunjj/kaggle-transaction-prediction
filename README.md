# Kaggle-Transaction-Prediction
This is my first try on kaggle and also my project for EE551!
## Description
* The competition name is [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction). It aims to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. 
* The competition start date is February 13 and end date is April 10. I will finish my work during this period.
* According to the given dataset [preview](https://github.com/smallsunjj/kaggle-transaction-prediction/blob/master/DataPreview.png), basically we can see this is a binary classification problem with 200 features.
## Timeline
* Week 1 
  * Extract basic features
  * Ready for initial model training.
* Week 2-4 
  * Learn the existing kernels and tools such as xgboost, lightgbm. 
  * Learn and implement my first model. 
  * Traning on the data set and submit my first outcome.
* Week 5-6
  * Learn and apply feature engineering in my model.
* Week 7-8
  * Learn and use other possible ways to improve my result.
## Final report
* My final ranking is [2331/8802](https://www.kaggle.com/smallsunjj), and my code and report is here.

## About
I'm new to machine learning so the task might sound difficult to me. But the important thing is I want to improve my python coding skill and gain lots of information in machine learning through this competition. Although I've spent much time making little progress on my final result, I feel satisfied for what I've learnt from kaggle community.
